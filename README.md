# cs50w-project-0-search
A front-end project that replicates the search interface of Google, Google Images, and Google Advanced Search. The project was developed as part of the CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course at Harvard University.


### **CS50W Project 0: Search**

This is my first project for the **CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** course at Harvard University. The project's goal was to replicate the interface and basic functionality of three Google search pages, using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

#### **Features**

The project consists of three main pages:

1.  **Google Search Page (`index.html`)**:
    * A centered search field.
    * Buttons for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky".
    * Links in the top right corner for the image search and advanced search pages.

2.  **Google Image Search Page (`imageSearch.html`)**:
    * A search field and a button to search for images.
    * A link to return to the main page.

3.  **Google Advanced Search Page (`advancedSearch.html`)**:
    * Four aligned text fields for advanced search ("all these words," "this exact word or phrase," "any of these words," and "none of these words").
    * A blue "Advanced Search" button.
    * A link to return to the main page.

#### **Technologies Used**

* **HTML**: For the structure and markup of the web pages.
* **CSS**: For styling and positioning all elements, replicating Google's visual design.
